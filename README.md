## 👩‍💻 How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Typescript, Vite, Redux-tool-kit

FrontEnd - Used React to help create the UI components, tailwind

## 🏸 Optimizations

**Things I would like to fix/add**
- Add Stripe payment
- Optimize the logic for which product to recommend
- Add more products for more skin type concerns and accessibility
- Create a backend database for all the products
- Create a backend allowing users to save their quiz results

## 💖 Why I made this

The main reason why I made this project was that I wanted to learn Typescript. 

I loosely followed a tutorial from [<kbd> 🎥 Youtube</kbd>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2NNxr3WPDo&ab_channel=EdRoh). 

Since I loved skincare, I thought it would be fun to make a skincare e-commerce site instead of a simple one-page site that leads to a contact form like the tutorial. 

**I thought I could challenge myself. I decided to include:**
<ul>
  <li>✨ A quiz for customers to find their ideal products and customized formualtions</li>
  <li>✨ A quiz to help find their skincare coutine</li>
  <li>✨ Ability for customers to buy the products - aka e-commerece</li>
</ul>

## 📝 Lessons Learned:

#### Being Proficient at a Language 

Learning and getting used to using Typescript was the biggest challenge. There were many times when I thought I knew what to do but when I included a Typescript to the recipe it became an entirely different animal. Although it was difficult, I was able to find answers or work around the problem.

One major problem I faced was using react, redux, and typescript together. Although redux and redux-toolkit is written in Typescript it was not really well documented, especially when you add redux to the formula. After extensive searching and help from others, I was able to find resources to help me apply Typescript to redux.

This taught me I still have a long journey to be proficient in Typescript, even those who are pretty good programmers can have a tough time with Typescript. 
I do know that getting used to using types is important. It can help create a less buggy and readable code. It is a challenge I will keep on working on.
